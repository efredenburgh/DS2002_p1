## Database Information:
- **Chinook** database is a "digital media store", with tables for artists, albums, customers, employees, invoices, etcetera using Apple iTunes data formed into a library [1].
- link to an image of the [Chinook Schema](https://schemaspy.org/samples/chinook/relationships.html) [2]


## Services Used:
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Launched with Anaconda Navigator) to perform most of the ETL process
- **MongoDB** Cluster to hold the 2 JSON files I extracted
- **MySQL** to create and populate the initial Chinook database, extract data from the tables in Chinook, and use data to create and populate dimension tables in chinook_dw
