## Services Used:
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Launched with Anaconda Navigator) to perform most of the ETL process
- **MongoDB** Cluster to hold the 2 JSON files I extracted
- **MySQL** to create and populate the initial Chinook database, extract data from the tables in Chinook, and use data to create and populate dimension tables in chinook_dw
